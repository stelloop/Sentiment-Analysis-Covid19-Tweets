# Sentiment-Analysis-Covid19-Tweets
ðŸ¦  This project involves conducting sentiment analysis on COVID-19 tweets obtained from Twitter, by using a combination of data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms. This project was part of the course "Data Mining Techniques", as taught in 2022 by professor [Dimitris Gunopulos](http://kddlab.di.uoa.gr/dg.html).

The project covers the following main topics:

- Data cleansing
- Data analysis, which includes analyzing sentiment distribution, identifying most common words, and making observations
- Vectorization techniques such as Bag-of-Words, Tf-Idf, and Word Embeddings
- Classification using algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and KNN
- Topic modeling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

This project is the result of a collaboration with [Giorgos Nikolaou](https://github.com/giorgosnikolaou).
